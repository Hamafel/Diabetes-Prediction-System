# Diabetes-Prediction-System

## Overview
This repository contains a diabetes prediction system designed to help identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes based on various health parameters. The system utilizes machine learning models to analyze data and provide predictions.

## Project Structure
- `data/` - Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `README.md` - Project documentation.

## Models Used
This project implements the following machine learning models:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**
3. **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
4. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages using the following commands:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
